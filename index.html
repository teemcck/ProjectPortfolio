        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Tristan, a computer science student in the Honors Program at the University of Michigan. 
            I'm deeply passionate about software engineering and videogame development. My goal is to create unique, 
            memorable experiences through games that motivate others to explore their passions. 
            I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'd love to share that experience with you.

            <h3>VisualMath</h3>
            <p>
                A mathematics visualization website that demonstrates topics through both simple and complex simulations.
                VisualMath is an active project and is being created with the intent of simplifying mathematics and being a freeuse
                education platform for students. It is being designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES7.

            <p>
                A strategy video card game where players must manage resources, leverage monster abilities, and adapt to dynamic events to outwit their opponent.
                This game is being developed in the Unity Game Engine using C#11, Blender 4.3 for models and animations, among many other miscellanous 
                software devices.

            <h3>WolverineSoft 2024 Pumpkin Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                48 hour game jam submission following the theme "Block Party." This game is a 2-player dynamic rhythm-based game where players
                synchronize actions to musical beats to outperform their opponent. There are 3 unique tracks, a regular and halloween them,
                and 9 unique characters to select from. This project was designed using C#11 inside of the Unity Game Engine.

        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>WolverineSoft 2024 Turkey Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                48 hour game jam submission following the theme "Counterproductive." This game is an asymetical, cooperative, infinite runner.
                Each game consists of a turkey, and a builder, who work together to progress as far as possible. This project was created using 
                Blender 4.3 for models and animations, and was programmed using C#11 inside the Unity Game Engine.

            <h3>WolverineSoft 2024 Mini Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                This 24 hour game jam was my first formal introduction to Unity and C#. Unlike typical game jams, all teams worked together to
                create one project, "WolveyWare," a parody of "WarioWare." Each person created a WarioWare like minigame to all be compiled together.
                My minigame, "Hide your Sins," was one of the games included. It was designed using C#11 inside of the Unity Game Engine.
